<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Daniel, a statistician and data scientist with a particular interest on applications in global public health and development policy.</p>

<p>I hold a master's degree in statistics from the University of Munich. Prior to my master's degree, I obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics with a minor in economics, also from the University of Munich.</p>

<p>My research interests are in Bayesian hierarchical modeling of spatio-temporal data and interpretable machine learning. I am also passionate about causal inference for public programme evaluation and machine learning for heterogeneous treatment effects. Other areas are survey data statistics and remotely sensed data.</p>

<p>In my master's thesis, I worked on intrinsic model and variable selection via statistical learning techniques for the identification of health risk factors of common disease burdens in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<p>During the last few years, I've gained practical experience in empirical research and applied statistics. In 2022, I completed an internship at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in New York, where I focused on quantifying uncertainty in composite indicators for their annual report. Additionally, I worked as a research assistant on statistical network analysis applied to the international arms trade.</p>

<p>I'm a German-Colombian dual citizen and currently based in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
