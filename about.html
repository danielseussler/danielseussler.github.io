<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Daniel, a statistician and data scientist with a particular interest on applications in global public health and development policy.</p>

<p>I hold a master's degree in statistics from the University of Munich. In my thesis, I worked on intrinsic model selection via statistical learning techniques for the identification health risk factors of common disease burdens in low- and middle-income countries. Prior to my master's degree, I obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics, also from the University of Munich, and studied Economics as well.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I've gained experience in both research and applied statistics. I completed an internship at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in New York, where I focused on quantifying uncertainty in composite indicators for their annual report. Previously, I worked as a research assistant on statistical network analysis applied to the international arms trade. Two publications stemming from this work are currently undergoing peer review.</p>

<p>I'm a German-Colombian dual citizen and currently based in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

<p>If you'd like to chat about research, don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
